Exercise 6.1.3	
	3. Add also a new column to ‘subjects’ called ‘course’. It will be a foreign key
	referencing the column ‘code’ in the table ‘courses’. To know how to write
	a foreign key in PostgreSQL, check this link. Keep in mind that, before
	creating the foreign key constraint, you will have to update the column
	‘subjects.course’ to have valid values (the code of one of the courses in
	table ‘course’).
